	<p>0. Enforcement of these rules is left to staff discretion. Staffmembers are held responsible for invocation of this rule.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Don't be an a-hole.<br><p>This server is a place for roleplayers to have a good time together. Our most important rule is to respect the other players, and to respect the friendly and welcoming environment we aim to create.</p></li>
		<li>You do not have a right to appeal.<br><p>You do not have a right to a second chance, and the staff is not required to consider any appeal you make. Bans may only be overturned at the combined discretion of more than one staffmember.</p></li>
		<li>Play as a believable character.<br><p>Roleplaying is strictly enforced on this server. If roleplaying as a character who would be believable within the bounds of our universe and lore doesn't interest you, then this server may not be for you.</p></li>
		<li>Escalate reasonably.<br><p>Escalation of conflict should remain reasonable. If someone steals something from you, then it is not appropriate to kill them, for example. Your character should try to minimize escalation and avoid harm.</p></li>
		<li>Respect the consequences of your actions.<br><p>If you commit a crime, don't be surprised when your character is imprisoned. If you use force, then don't be surprised when it's responded to with force.</p></li>
		<li>Illegal or 18+ content is strictly forbidden.<br><p>Erotic Roleplaying (ERP), pornography, any other adult/illegal content, or links to the aforementioned content is strictly verboten.</p></li>
		<li>Staffmembers aren't always right, but you still have to listen to them.<br><p>The word of the staff is law, even if it doesn't match the text of the rules. If a staffmember is found to be abusing their power via internal audit, then they will be terminated immediately, and banned permanantly.</p></li>
		<li>If we don't want you playing on our server, then we reserve the right to remove you from it.<br><p>Attempting to bypass the letter of the rules, or simply being a consistent nuisance will result in punitive action.</p></li>

	<p>?. The rule of cool<br>Any protection that this rule provides is rescinded the moment you attempt to invoke it or abuse it. Breaking the rules within the spirit of believable and enjoyable roleplay is acceptable. However, the more seriously you break a rule, the more justified your character will need to be in commiting the rulebreaking action.</p>
	<p>If you believe that a staffmember is abusing their power or is negligent in their duties, contact the Host or Administrator.</p>
