  <h3>Redshift is a Roleplaying-Focused Space Station 13 Server</h3>
  <p>This server is set on a tether station orbiting Ceres in the early 2200s. It provides refueling and re-supplying services to vessels passing between the inner and outer planets. But beware, the asteroid belt is a lawless void filled with the worst sorts of pirates, outlaws and vagabonds.</p>
  <p>We are a roleplaying-enforced server. You must play as a believable and relatively sane character, who fits within the setting laid forth. All of your actions will have consequences either within the universe, or if you break our rules, OOCly. If enforced roleplaying and permanant consequences don't sound like your cup of tea, then this server isn't for you. If it does, then welcome to Redshift!</p>
